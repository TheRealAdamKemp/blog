Markus Schiller at [App & Mensch](http://www.appundmensch.de) did something awesome. He created a [Roslyn Diagnostic Analyzer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn879356.aspx) to look for one of my [iOS Layout Gotchas](http://blog.adamkemp.com/2014/11/ios-layout-gotchas-and-view-controller.html). Check out his [blog post](http://www.appundmensch.de/blog/2015/2/18/the-roslyn-report-writing-diagnostic-analyzers-for-xamarin-part-2) explaining how.

Roslyn is going to be a boon to static code analysis, and I can't wait to see what else we can do with it.
